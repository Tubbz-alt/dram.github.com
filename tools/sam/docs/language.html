<h1 class="title">Semantic Authoring Markdown (SAM)</h1>

<div class="introduction">
<div class="note">
<p class="p">This document is a formal description of the SAM language. It describes the formalisms behind the syntax and it may make SAM sound a lot more complex to work with than it really is. If you just want to learn how to write in SAM, see the <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="document">SAM Quick Start</span></span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Semantic Authoring Markdown (SAM) is a simplified markup for semantic authoring. Semantic authoring means writing texts that identify some part of their semantics thought embedded markup. Semantic authoring also places constraints on the author, making sure they create the content that is required. Semantic authoring allows for sophisticated validation and manipulation of content, supporting increased quality and improving the efficiency of the publishing process.</p>
<p class="p">SAM is a tale that grew in the telling. It was designed from the bottom up, not the top down, and so formalizing the language description comes after the fact. This document is a step along the way to a fully formal definition. There is not yet a full formal grammar for SAM. It is possible that the development of such a grammar could reveal ambiguities in the language definition that might require design changes in the future.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Why SAM?</h2>

<p class="p">Why is SAM needed? What are the limits of current semantic authoring solutions? The core of a semantic authoring solution is a markup language. There are, broadly, two kinds of markup languages: general and lightweight. Lightweight markup languages are easier to use, but less capable. <span class="phrase"><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML class="link">XML</a></span> is the only general languages in common use today (thought SGML is also still in use). There are many lightweight markup languages. The best known is Markdown.</p>
<p class="p">The key issue for real semantic authoring is extensibility: the ability to specify your own semantics. (To create new tag that are specific to what you are writing about.)</p>
<p class="p">Current lightweight markup languages have fixed semantics with little or no extensibility. Where extensibility exists, it generally requires coding extensions to the parser.</p>
<p class="p">XML supports extensibility through schemas. But the price it pays for this is an abstract data model and a verbose syntax. Writing and editing in XML is cumbersome, even with a dedicated XML editor (and dedicated XML editors can be expensive). And while XML is intended for doing structured writing, in practice it tends to hide the structure of the content either behind a WYSIWYG editing interface or verbose markup.</p>
<p class="p">SAM attempts to bridge these two worlds, providing a lightweight syntax that is easy to read, write, and edit, and which makes the structure of the content clear and explicit. SAM is also designed to be extensible and to support the specification of new tags through a schema. (Currently the SAM Parser uses an XML schema language to validate the output XML, but a true SAM schema language is planned.)</p>
<p class="p">Most lightweight markup languages provide a fixed set of document structures with little or no extensibility. XML provides no document structures by default and makes you specify everything in a schema. SAM defines a limited set of core text structures such as paragraph and lists and then leaves it to you to specify the semantic structures that contain the text.</p>
<p class="p">It is important to note that SAM is not designed as a language for text representation. That is, it is not a language designed for taking an existing text, and, without violence to that text, adding metadata to explicate its meaning or structure. For that you need a form of markup with the ability to clearly delineate in-band and out-of-band data. XML provides this by consigning in-band data (the text of the document) to the textual content of elements, and out-of-band (metadata describing the document) to attributes. SAM defines a few preset management attributes but provided no facility for creating new ones. Any additional metadata you want to add to a block, for instance, has to take the form or fields. This muddies the distinction between in-band and out-of-band information. For content creation, this is entirely appropriate, and the whole element/attribute distinction is tedious and confusing. If you are looking for a markup language that is designed so that you can simply remove the markup and be left with the original document, SAM is not the right choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Processing model</h2>

<p class="p">SAM is a cross between an abstract or meta language like XML and a concrete language like MarkDown. XML does not describe the semantics of any of the tagging languages you base on it. The XML parser does not implement any markup semantics. Implementing semantics is left to the application layer -- another program or set of program that process the output of the parser. In many XML-based tool chains, the application layer is written in XSLT. Markdown describes the entire semantics of the language. The Markdown processor executes the entire semantics of the language, producing HTML output directly from Markdown. It does not require a separate application layer.</p>
<p class="p">SAM follows the XML model. The SAM parser simply reads the SAM markup and extracts its structures. It does not interpret the semantics of the document, but leaves that to the application layer.</p>
<p class="p">A SAM parser may make the structure of a SAM document available to the applications layer in different ways. It can expose the structure via an API and/or it may output an XML representation of the structure of the SAM document.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Semantics</h2>

<p class="p">While the SAM parser does not act on the semantics of the document, deferring that to the application layer, it contains concrete markup which the writer is entitled to expect will be processed in a particular way. These are the intended semantics of SAM structures. The application layer is expected to honor and implement the semantics of SAM markup.</p>
<p class="p">A lot of SAM's concrete markup is simply shortcuts for common writing structures like lists. The exact same structures could be created using blocks, fields, and paragraphs, and you can create variant structures (other types of lists, for example) using these standard components. However, some of SAM's concrete markup expresses a particular view about markup language design. For example, it use of annotations and citations expresses a particular view about how text inside paragraphs should be marked up. Since SAM does not provide other facilities to create markup in paragraphs, it may not be suitable for expressing all types of markup language design. SAM is not, and is not intended to be, a full replacement for XML.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">SAM Structure</h2>

<p class="p">Like all other markup languages, a SAM document is essentially a set a set of nested blocks of various types. In concrete markup languages like markdown there are a fixed set of block types, each with a specific meaning, and each with a corresponding piece of syntax that allows the parser to identify them. In an abstract markup language like XML, there are a few abstract block types that have no inherent meaning, but can be named so that a processing application can attach meaning to the name in specific markup languages. Thus a paragraph is represented with a <code class="code">&lt;p&gt;</code> element in HTML but by a <code class="code">&lt;para&gt;</code> element in DocBook.</p>
<p class="p">As a hybrid language, SAM has a set of concrete block types, each with its own semantics and syntax, and a set of abstract nameable block types that can be used to define additional semantics for specific SAM-based markup languages. Thus in SAM a <span class="phrase">paragraph</span> is always created as a block of text, but you can create named blocks to capture things like <code class="code">author-name:</code>.</p>
<p class="p">Blocks may contain flows. A flow is a data value, the contents of a block, but a flow can also contain other structures. This is also a common feature of document markup languages. In HTML, for instance, you can have an <code class="code">&lt;a&gt;</code> element in the middle of a paragraph to create a link. XML-based languages, including HTML, use elements for structures within a flow (creating something called mixed content). In SAM, structures within a flow are distinct from blocks and have a different syntax.</p>
<p class="p">Four kinds of structures can exist in a flow, a <span class="phrase">phrase</span>, an <span class="phrase">insert</span>, and a <span class="phrase">citation</span>. However, a <span class="phrase">phrase</span> can be annotated to indicate its semantics, which makes <span class="phrase">phrase</span>s an extensible feature of SAM.</p>
<p class="p">The following example shows a <span class="phrase">paragraph</span> with two annotated <span class="phrase">phrase</span>s.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">In {Rio Bravo}(movie), {the Duke}(actor "John Wayne" (SAG)) plays a union colonel.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">SAM Syntax</h2>

<p class="p">Syntactically, SAM takes its cues from YAML and Python (for displaying overall structure), from Markdown (for displaying text structures) and from common English usage (for displaying annotations.) In contrast to some of the richer lightweight markup languages, it tries to minimize the use of exotic forms of punctuation to delineate structures.</p>
<p class="p">The intention is that an author writing in SAM should feel no need to use a visual editor, but should work directly in raw SAM (albeit with editor-supplied syntax coloring if desired). A SAM document should be a very natural read.</p>
<p class="p">SAM is not designed to be a full replacement for XML. It is far less general, because of its use of predefined syntax for common text structures such as lists and paragraphs, and it has very limited support for attributes. Basically, each structure has a fixed set of attributes available. There is no extensibility for attributes. This is essential to maintain the readability of SAM sources, but it limits certain styles of markup design.</p>
<p class="p">In particular, SAM is designed to support a declarative approach to semantic authoring meaning that it is designed to express declarations about the structure of the document and the meaning of the text, rather than to embed management and processing information into the source, a practice common in many structured authoring languages.</p>
<p class="p">Document-oriented markup languages such as reStructuredText and Markdown tend to be very flat in structure. One things follows another. There is rarely a case where one thing is inside another. For example, these languages use heading levels, but don't delineate sections of the document. More semantically rich languages tend to be more hierarchical, with one structure inside another. For example, a document might be divided into sections with title and paragraph elements inside a section. This means that you need to show which structures are inside others and where the containing structure ends.</p>
<p class="p">XML does this by having an explicit end tag for every element. A large part of the verbosity of XML comes from its requirement to close every element tag. Many programming languages, which similarly have to express nested structures, use some form of brackets to delineate each structure. Python is an exception to this. It uses indentation to express the relationship between structures. This is a far more natural way for writers to express the subordination of elements -- one that is sometimes also used in published works. SAM uses this approach and avoids the use of end tags entirely.</p>
<p class="p">SAM syntax defines the following structures:</p>
<dl class="ll">
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">named block</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">Named blocks are structures that contain other structures. For instance, a section is a block. Blocks must have names. Named blocks (and named fields) are how you introduce new structures into a SAM document. Named blocks may be referred to a "blocks" in this document, but all of SAMs concrete block types are also blocks.</p>
</dd>

<div class="ll.li">

</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nametoken">
<h2 class="title">Name tokens</h2>

<p class="p">Several things in SAM have names. These names must be valid name tokens. A name token in a SAM document must be a valid XML local name. This is to allow ease of integration with XML tools and languages and for a straightforwards serialization of SAM documents to XML.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" data-name="name-like-string">
<h2 class="title">Name-like string</h2>

<p class="p">A name like string is a string that looks like a name. Name-like strings are used in parsing SAM files to detect the intention of the author to create a name. Not all name-like-strings are valid names. If the parser sees a name-like-string that is not a valid name, it reports an error.</p>
<p class="p">The reason for recognizing name-like-strings rather than only recognizing valid names is that it enables the parser to catch cases where the writer probably intended to create a name but failed to create a valid name.</p>
<p class="p">By recognizing name-like-strings the parser is able to report an errors on these dubious cases, which reduce the likelihood or misinterpreting the author's intent. In the case where the name-like-string is indeed intended to be interpreted as plain text, the writer can ensure it is interpreted as such by escaping the concluding colon with a backslash.</p>
<p class="p">However, the definition of a name-like-string can't interfere with the recognition of other SAM structures. Therefore name-like-strings don't include characters that might be mistaken for SAM markup.</p>
<p class="p">The current definition of a name-like-string is as follows, but this is subject to change:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="re"><code class="codeblock" data-language="re">(?P&lt;name&gt;\w[^\s`]*?) 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section" data-name="syntax">
<h2 class="title">Syntax</h2>

<p class="p">A <span class="phrase">block</span> in SAM is formed by starting a line with a name followed by a colon:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">description:
    This is the content of a block named "description".
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Structures in SAM can contain other structures. The hierarchy of structures in SAM is defined by indentation. In the example above, the paragraph structure is inside the block named description because it is indented under it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" data-name="SOM">
<h2 class="title">SAM Object Model</h2>

<p class="p">The SAM Object Model is a way of representing the structure of a SAM document as a data structure to a computer program. The SAM object model is a way for program to access a SAM document in a standard way. Unless you are concerned with writing programs to access the SAM Object Model you can ignore all references to it in this document. The SAM Object model is the model implemented by the current SAM parser, which is written in Python. However, SAM parsers are not required to implement the SAM Object Model.</p>
<p class="p">The other way for applications to access the structure of is by serializing it to XML. This is the only require access method for parsers to implement.</p>
<p class="p">Like the language itself, the SOM is a tale that grew in the telling. In the absence of a full formal grammar for SAM, the object model must be considered provisional. It should be considered a less stable interface to a SAM document than the canonical XML serialization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" data-name="parser">
<h2 class="title">Parsing</h2>

<p class="p">A SAM document may be interpreted by a SAM parser to form an object tree in memory, which can include the <span class="phrase">SAM object model</span> or any standardized XML representation such as SAX or DOM. In these cases, the DOM or SAX interface should represent the standard XML serialization, or an optional variant of that serialization, not the SOM. A SAM parser must offer the option of serializing the document as XML. A SAM parser may offer various methods of serializing XML, but it must default to the serialization described in this document.</p>

<p class="p">A <span class="phrase">block</span> is a named container for other structures. <span class="phrase">Blocks</span> and <span class="phrase">fields</span> are the extensible structures of a <span class="phrase">SAM</span> document that allow you to create a document with specific semantics in any of the <span class="phrase">structured writing domains</span>.</p>
<p class="p">Like a <span class="phrase">field</span>, a <span class="phrase">block</span> can have a value. However, a block can also have children. A block is simply a field with children. (Or you could equally say that a field is a block without children.)</p>
<p class="p">Blocks are used to model large document structures such as sections. The value of the block is treated as the title of the section.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">A block is syntactically identical to a <span class="phrase">field</span>. It is distinguished from a field based on whether or not it has children. The children of a block are any structures following the block header that are indented more than the block header.</p>
<p class="p">The following example defines a block named <code class="code">movie-review</code>. It is a block because it has children. Its children are the field <code class="code">movie</code> and the block <code class="code">stars</code>:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">movie-review: Wayne shines in Rio Bravo

<p class="p">The <code class="code">movie-review</code> block as a value, <code class="code">Wayne shines in Rio Bravo' which will be treated as the title of the block on serialization. The </code>stars` block does not have a value. Its function is to act as a container for the list of stars. (As part of the regular structure of a movie review, the list of stars would likely be assigned a title during output processing, but it does not need one in the source.)</p>

<p class="p">Any type of <span class="phrase">block</span> can be the <span class="phrase">document block</span>, including concrete structures such as paragraphs and lists. However, choosing a structure other than a named <span class="phrase">block</span> as the document block will be extremely limiting, as most concrete structure types allow for little or no nesting of other blocks. For instance, nothing can be nested under a <span class="phrase">paragraph</span>, so while a paragraph can be the document block of a SAM document, it would also be the only structure in the document.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">The <span class="phrase">document block</span> is not indented. All other structures in the document (excluding <span class="phrase">comments</span>, <span class="phrase">declarations</span>, and <span class="phrase">string definitions</span>) must be children of the <span class="phrase">document block</span>, and therefore must be indented under it.

<p class="p">Once the first line of a paragraph has been identified, the parser simply accumulates subsequent lines, without looking for other structures, until one of the following is encountered:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<p class="p">A blank line.</p>

<h2 class="title">Annotation</h2>

<p class="p">Annotations clarify what a piece of text is about. Whereas the role of an <span class="phrase">attribute</span> is to attach management metadata, the role of an attribute is to attach metadata that clarifies exactly what the phrase is describing so that it can be reliably processed by algorithms.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">An <span class="phrase">annotation</span> is attached to a phrase and is expressed as an expression in parentheses following the closing <code class="code">}</code> of the phrase with no space in between.</p>
<p class="p">An annotation specifies the type of a string. Here the type expression says that the string "Rio Bravo" is a reference to a movie:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">In {Rio Bravo}(movie), {the Duke}(actor "John Wayne" (SAG)) plays a union colonel.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">There are three parts to an annotation:</p>
<dl class="ll">
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">type</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">The first word immediately following the opening parentheses is the type of the subject being annotated. In the sample above, "Rio Bravo" is a movie and "the Duke" is an actor. An annotation type must be a valid SAM <span class="phrase">name</span>. The annotation type is required.</p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">specifically</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">In some cases, the annotated text may not specify its subject clearly. In this case, the specifically attribute is use to clarify what is meant. The specifically attribute is a string in double or single straight quotes. In the sample above, "the Duke" means, specifically, "John Wayne". The specifically attribute is optional.</p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">namespace</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">In some cases, it is necessary to specify the namespace to which the annotated term belongs. The namespace attribute follows the specifically attribute (if specified) and is contained in parentheses. In the sample above, the name of the actor "John Wayne" is part of a set of names managed by the Screen Actors Guild which makes sure two actors don't use the same stage name. (In most cases, the namespace is implied by the type, so you will not usually need to specify it.) The namespace attribute is optional. (Note that the namespace attribute of an annotation is not related to the concept of the namespace of an block or field name. It is the namespace of the value, not the namespace of the container.)</p>
</dd>
</div>
</dl>
<p class="p">If you are annotating the same phrase more than one in the same file. You can skip the annotation metadata and just use curly braces around the phrase. The parser will copy the metadata from the last occurring instance of that same phrase.</p>
</div>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">The specific semantics of individual annotation depend on the language designer, however, in order to maintain consistency across languages, it is important to use the specifically and namespace attributes for their intended purposes and not to hijack them to express some other semantics.</p>
<p class="p">Annotations may be from any of the <span class="phrase">structured writing domains</span> (media, document, subject, management). The relationship between the annotation type and the meaning of the specifically attribute changes in each domain.</p>
<p class="p">In the media domain, the annotation type refers to some media property to be applied to the text, and the specifically attribute supplies more specific information. For example it could be <code class="code">{the Duke}(highlight "yellow")</code> or <code class="code">{the Duke}(link "http://JohnWayne.com")</code>.</p>
<p class="p">In the document domain, the annotation type refer to some document property, and the specifically attribute supplies more specific information. For example, it could be <code class="code">{the Duke}(index "Wayne, John")</code>.</p>
<p class="p">In the subject domain, the annotation type refers to the type of the subject being referred to and the specifically attribute clarifies the intended subject if required. For example `<span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="actor" data-specifically="John Wayne">the Duke</span></span>.</p>
<p class="p">The key to using the annotation attributes correctly is simply to make sure that the attribute names apply in a reasonable fashion to the values they contain. If they don't, a different markup strategy should be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="xml-serialization">
<p class="p">An annotation is serialized to XML as an <code class="code">&lt;annotation&gt;</code> element. The type, specifically, and namespace attributes become attributes with those names in XML.</p>
<p class="p">The <code class="code">&lt;annotation&gt;</code> element is wrapped inside the <code class="code">&lt;phrase&gt;</code> element that it annotation, with the content of the phrase on the inside.</p>

<p class="p">When a phrase has one or more annotations, those annotations are wrapped inside the <code class="code">&lt;phrase&gt;</code> element in the order in which they occur in the source document. Thus the following:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">The film starred {John Wayne}(actor)(director), who also directed.

<div class="structure" data-name="citation">
<h2 class="title">Citation</h2>

<p class="p">Citations are a reference to another resource. This includes internal references to other structures within the document, such as to a graphic,procedure, or footnote, as well as references to external works. Citations are supported wherever <span class="phrase">attributes</span> or <span class="phrase">annotations</span> are supported.</p>
<p class="p">Citations come in two form. Textual citations cite a resource using whatever citation format the language designer or writer wishes to use. Reference citations cite a resource by its <span class="phrase">id</span>, <span class="phrase">name</span>, or <span class="phrase">key</span>.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">A citation is created using square brackets:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">Moby Dick[Melville, 1851] is about a big fish.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">They can also be applied to a phrase, rather then floating in the text.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">{Moby Dick}[Melville, 1851] is about a big fish.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Citations can be chained with annotations:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">{Moby Dick}(novel)[Melville, 1851] is about a big fish.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Citations can also be added to <span class="phrase">blocks</span>. The most obvious application of this is <span class="phrase">blockquote</span>s:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">"""[Melville, 1851] 
    Call me Ishmael.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">SAM has no opinion about the format of a citation text. That is entirely up to the application layer to decipher.</p>
<p class="p">You can  use reference citations to reference other parts of the current document or other documents. To cite a resource that has an id within the current SAM document, reference the id like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">Moby Dick is about a big fish[*fn.moby]. See [*fig.whale].

fig:(*whale)
    &gt;&gt;&gt;(image whale.png)

footnote:(*moby)
    Actually, Moby Dick is a whale, not a fish.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Citation by <span class="phrase">id</span>, <span class="phrase">name</span>, or <span class="phrase">key</span> can include additional information. For example, if you have a bibliography where each bibliography entry has a name assigned to it, you could cite the work by reference to the name, and then add additional information for the page number.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">"""[#Moby page 1] 
    Call me Ishmael.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The additional information is anything between the end of the <span class="phrase">name</span> and the closing square bracket.</p>
</div>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">The function of a citation is to generate a piece of content in the output that is a reference to the specified resource. Some text should always be generated in the place where the citation is specified. What type of reference that is depends of the type of object that is being referenced. Generating such references is the job of the <span class="phrase">application layer</span>.</p>
<p class="p">The purpose of a citation is not to create a link. Links should be created using <span class="phrase">annotation</span>s. However, the reference generated by a citation may include a link to the resource in question if appropriate.</p>
<p class="p">The semantics of a reference by <span class="phrase">id</span>, <span class="phrase">name</span>, or <span class="phrase">key</span>, depend on the type of the structure referred to. This is different from the usage in some specific markup languages in XML where there may be a specific element used to reference a footnote, such as <code class="code">&lt;footnote idref="fn.moby"/&gt;</code>. In SAM, all references are generic citations, which would serialize as &lt;citation idref="fn.moby"&gt;. This means that in order for the application layer to determine what kind of reference to generate for a citation, it needs to look up the type of the resource being referenced. Thus to determine that it should create a footnote reference, the application layer needs to look up the structure with the id <code class="code">fn.moby</code> and determine its type. Once it determines that the type is footnote, it knows to create a footnote reference.</p>
<p class="p">While it is not required, it is a good idea for markup designers and writers to adopt and follow a convention for naming the IDs and names of structures to reflect their type, such as in the use of <code class="code">fn.</code> and <code class="code">fig.</code> prefixes in these examples.</p>
<p class="p">The semantics of a citation of an external work is that it will generate a reference to that work in whatever citation format is appropriate for publication. This means that a citation that is inline in the SAM document does not necessarily imply that an inline citation format will be used on output. The SAM citation is just capturing the citation information. It is up to the application layer to decide how to present it, including removing the citation to a footnote or endnote if appropriate. The language designer is entitled to specify any citation format they like, and to interpret it in any way they like.</p>
<p class="p">Additional information in a citation is simply passed through to the application layer. SAM does not specify any semantics for it.</p>

<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">&gt;&gt;&gt;(~deluxe-intro)(?model=deluxe)
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Remember that it is up to the application layer to implement such inserts.</p>
<p class="p">You can use any name you like for the insert type, however the following types are reserved so that editors can act on them to provide enhanced views of the document while editing:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<p class="p">image</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p">video</p>

<li class="li">

<li class="li">
<p class="p">app</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p">object</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">They should be used only with their natural semantics. Note, however, that the spec does not prescribe a mechanism for identifying the object to insert. The item will, of course, be identified by a URL, but how that URL is to be interpreted is not specified. For instance, it could point to an intermediate resource such as an XML file that contains information used to choose the appropriate object for a particular media. The SAM language spec does not specify the format or interpretation for such a file.</p>
</div>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">The insert is an instruction to the application layer to insert the specified resource. While implementation is entirely up to the applications layer, SAM specifies the semantics of the reserved insert types as follows:</p>
<dl class="ll">
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">image</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">Insert the graphic image into the output.</p>

<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">Inserts a generic object (per HTML5 'object' tag.)</p>
</dd>
</div>
</dl>
<p class="p">The semantics of inserting by reference to an <span class="phrase">ID</span>, <span class="phrase">name</span>, or <span class="phrase">variable</span>, or <span class="phrase">key</span> are as follows:</p>
<dl class="ll">
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">a SAM <span class="phrase">ID</span></dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">Insert the resource pointed to by the <span class="phrase">ID</span> in a manner appropriate to its type.</p>

</dd>
</div>
</dl>
<p class="p">Note that you are not obliged to use any of these types in order to do their assigned functions. You can devise any insert types you like, since responsibility for implementing them rests entirely with the application layer. The constraint is that you should not assign other semantics to these names. Having a standard set simply allows for editors to presume the semantics of the basic types and act on them if they wish.</p>

<p class="p">For direct inserts, it will check if the insert type is in its list of known insert types and the file extension is in its list of known file types. If both conditions are true, it will insert it in the document using an HTML <code class="code">object</code> element. For a block insert, the <code class="code">object</code> element will be wrapped in a <code class="code">div</code> element with the class attribute set to <code class="code">insert</code> as well as any of the standard attributes that are present:</p>

<p class="p">If the insert type or file type are not in the lists, a warning is issued and the insert is ignored.</p>
<p class="p">For inserts by reference, HTML output mode attempts to find and resolve certain types by looking up the referenced structure and inserting it at the point of the insert. HTML output mode does not guarantee that the results of inserting a structure from elsewhere in the document will produce valid HTML in all cases. The following insert by reference cases are supported:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<p class="p">Inline inserts of variables.</p>

<div class="structure" data-name="codeblock">
<h2 class="title">Codeblock</h2>

<p class="p">A codeblock is a block of computer code or data, or any other material with its own syntax that is to be presented as part of the document content. The contents of a codeblock are not interpreted by the SAM parser but are presented as entered in the source.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">Codeblocks begin with three back ticks followed by optional <span class="phrase">attribute</span>s.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">```(python)
    print("Hello World.")
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Code must be indented under the codeblock marker. The codeblock ends at the first line that is less indented than the codeblock marker, or at the end of the file.</p>
<p class="p">Codeblocks take the standard <span class="phrase">attribute</span> types.</p>
<p class="p">Because is is delineated by indentation, the contents of a codeblock do not require any character escaping, and no SAM character escapes are recognized in a codeblock. The text is taken literally without modification of any kind.</p>
<p class="p">Thus, for instance, you can show blocks of SAM in a SAM codeblock (as this document does) without any need for escaping any part of the markup.</p>
</div>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">The text of the codeblock is not processed as SAM markup. It is recorded as is with no interpretation or escape processing. Line breaks are preserved as in the original.</p>
<p class="p">Because indentation may be significant in a codeblock, and because the code will be indented under the codeblock header in the SAM source, the SAM parser uses the following algorithm to distinguish SAM indenting from indenting in the code itself: The parser looks at all the lines that are indented under the codeblock header, finds the one with the smallest indent, and treats it as occurring at the first column in the code. This allows for cases where the first line of a code sample may not be the least indented line. (That is, the first line of the code sample may be more indented than some of the lines that follow.) It also means that all codeblocks will be formatted with zero initial indent.</p>
<p class="p">The semantics of the language attribute are slightly different for codeblocks, or at least, the implication of the semantics is. For other blocks, the language attribute denotes the human language of the text. For a codeblock, it denotes the computer or data language of the codeblock. In the unlikely event that you need to apply both languages, you should use a wrapper around the codeblock to capture the human language. For example, you might do this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">code-sample:(fr)
    ```(sam)
        La Plume de ma Tante.

<p class="p">Decorations are not recognized inside of <span class="phrase">phrase</span>s, since decorations are shorcuts for phrases and phrases cannot be nested. Decoration characters inside annotations are read as plain text.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="structure" data-specifically="annotation">Annotation</span></span> chaining is supported for decorations. Therefore if you want to make text both both and italic, you could use:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">This text is *important*(italic)

</code></pre>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">In SAM, the bold and italic decorations are media domain structures calling for the use of bold and italic typefaces respectively. This is in contrast to most lightweight markup languages which use them (or similar markup) to mean an abstraction like "emphasis" or "strong". The problem with these abstractions is that their meaning in not clear. Bold and italic type are conventionally used for specific purposes and should not be abstracted out without some definite indication of the purpose. Thus in SAM, you would normally expect a tagging language that expected the titles of books to occur regularly in content would provide a suitable <code class="code">title</code> annotation to mark them up.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">{Moby Dick}(book) is about a whale.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">But if there the tagging language provides no such support, because books are not a significant subject for that language, then the writer who needs to mention a book should not be forced to use a vague and unreliable abstraction like <code class="code">emphasis</code> in order to ensure proper formatting of the title. They should be able to specify the correct media domain formatting choice:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">_Moby Dick_ is about a whale.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Which is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">{Moby Dick}(italic) is about a whale.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">And we should note in this case that the abstract <code class="code">emphasis</code> is not only vague, it is actually incorrect. This is not a case of emphasizing a word, but of formatting a book title according to the commonly accepted convention. If you actually want an emphasis annotation in your tagging language, you should do it like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">{Moby Dick}(italic) is a {very}(emphasis) good book.

<h2 class="title">Variable</h2>

<p class="p">A variable is a way to store a value (specifically, a <span class="phrase">Flow</span>) that can be inserted into any part of a document. Variable definitions are scoped, meaning that you can locally override the value of a variable. This can be used to replace values in a block of text that is reused by reference.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">A variable definition is created by the appropriate indent followed by a <code class="code">$</code> and a <span class="phrase">name-like-string</span> followed by an <code class="code">=</code> and the value of the variable. The variable value ends at the end of the current line:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">$foo = bar
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The variable can then be inserted using a <span class="phrase">block insert</span> or <span class="phrase">inline insert</span>:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">The sentence includes a string insert &gt;($foo).

&gt;&gt;&gt;($foo)
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Variable definitions do not take any <span class="phrase">attributes</span>. The variable name is a <span class="phrase">name token</span>.</p>
<p class="p">In XML output mode, the resolution of variables is left to the <span class="phrase">application layer</span>. This allows the application layer to consider variables definitions from outside the local file.</p>
<p class="p">In HTML output mode, variables are resolved using definitions in the local file. A warning is issued if the variable cannot be resolved and the insertion is skipped.</p>
</div>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">Within a local file, variable are local to the scope in which they are defined.</p>
<p class="p">When resolving a variable, the application layer should first look at any variable definitions that are children of the insert statement. If no matching variable definition is found, it should then work its way up the tree, looking in the parent structure and then the preceding siblings of the parent structure and so on to the document root. Note that this is not the same as searching in reverse document order, since it does not look in children of preceding siblings.</p>
<p class="p">The application layer is entitled to introduce variable definitions from outside the local file. Such variables should always be last in the search order for variable definitions. In other words, the most local definition always wins. System designers may want to consider imposing variable naming conventions to avoid accidental variable name conflicts.</p>

<div class="structure" data-name="fragment">
<h2 class="title">Fragment</h2>

<p class="p">A fragment is a chunk of content that is set off so that it can be managed separately from the rest of the document. Reasons for creating a fragment could include making a chunk of the document conditional or available for reuse. A fragment is essentially a block of content that has no semantic identity of its own, but exists only to be managed arbitrarily, such as for ad hoc reuse of text that is not based on reusing a complete <span class="phrase">semantic block</span>. Examples include passages that are conditionalized for use in different contexts.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">Fragments are created beginning a line with the <code class="code">~</code> characters:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">This paragraph is outside the fragment.

~~~(?foo)

    This paragraph is inside the fragment and should only appear if the {condition} `foo` is true.

This paragraph is outside the fragment again and will always be included.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">You can allow for the redefinition of parts of the text of a fragment by defining a variable inside a fragment and use that variable in the definition of the fragment text:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">~~~(#my-fragment) 
    $color=black 
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To insert a fragment:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">&gt;&gt;&gt;(#my-fragment)
</code></pre>
<p class="p">As per the <span class="phrase">variable</span> scoping rules, any redefinition of those variable as children of the insert will override the values in the fragment. Thus:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">&gt;&gt;&gt;(#my-fragment)
    $color=white
</code></pre>
<p class="p">should be resolved to:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">Bar bar white sheep Have you any wool?
</pre>
<p class="p">(But remember that <span class="phrase">variable</span> resolution is performed by the <span class="phrase">application layer</span> in <span class="phrase">XML output mode</span> but by the SAM parser in <span class="phrase">HTML output mode</span>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">The handling of fragments and strings belongs to the <span class="phrase">application layer</span>.</p>
<p class="p">Semantically, a fragment is just an arbitrary chunk of the document hierarchy. If it is inserted somewhere using an <span class="phrase">insert</span> with a <span class="phrase">idref</span>, <span class="phrase">nameref</span>, or <span class="phrase">keyref</span>, then the fragment is to be inserted at that location.</p>
<p class="p">If a fragment is reuse in this way, and if there are <span class="phrase">stringref</span>s in the body of the fragment, any strings defined in the fragment <span class="phrase">insert</span> override those defined in the fragment and any other string definitions of the same name.</p>
<p class="p">Fragments can be nested inside other fragments. Fragments can contain <span class="phrase">inserts</span> of other fragments. Circular fragment references are illegal but must be caught at the application layer.</p>

<p class="p">You can include one SAM file in another. The included file must be a complete SAM file.

<p class="p">Unlike inserts, which are simply passed on to the application layer for processing, the file pointed to by an <span class="phrase">include</span> is parsed by the parser. The result of the include is presented to the application layer as part of the parsed document.</p>
<p class="p">The ID uniqueness constraint that applies to individual SAM document also applies to included files. The IDs must be unique across the entire document parsed from the source file and any included files.</p>
<p class="p">Includes cannot be made conditional, since conditions are parsed by the application layer and includes are processed by the parser.</p>
<p class="p">If you need to apply a condition to an include, place the include in a fragment and make the fragment conditional. This will result in the file being parsed and included in the output, but its content will be inside the fragment, making the whole thing conditional.</p>
<p class="p">For similar reasons, an include cannot have a <span class="phrase">name</span>, <span class="phrase">id</span>, or <span class="phrase">language</span> attribute, since the include instruction itself is not present in the output. If you need to apply any of these things to the included content, you can wrap the include statement in another structure such as a <span class="phrase">block</span> or a <span class="phrase">fragment</span> and apply the attributes to that. This will result in the included content being wrapped in that block or fragment in the output where the application layer can deal with it appropriately.</p>
