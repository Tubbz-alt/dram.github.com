article: NetHack and Cygwin

	Althouth there is a detailed {how-to}(http://planetexpress.homedns.org/nethack/compile_cygwin.txt) to help with compiling NetHack under Cygwin, I can't get a working NetHack with it. After some experiments, I managed to compile NetHack under Cygwin correctly.

	The packages you need:

	```
		util-linux bison flex gcc-core

	First, run setup.sh from sys/unix.

	Then modify these lines:

	```
		include/config.h
		 1) Line 288: Uncomment #define STRNCMPI
		 2) Line 172: Comment out #define COMPRESS "/usr/bin/compress"
		 3) Line 173: Comment out #define COMPRESS_EXTENSION ".Z"
		 4) Line 175: Uncomment and change this line to
				   #define COMPRESS "/usr/bin/gzip"
		 5) Line 176: Uncomment #define COMPRESS_EXTENSION ".gz"

		win/tty/termap.c
		 1) Line 839: Comment out extern char *tparm();

		src/Makefile
		 1) Line 234: Comment out WINTTYLIB = -ltermlib
		 2) Line 233: Uncomment # WINTTYLIB = -lncurses

		util/Makefile
		 1) Line 104: Comment out YACC=yacc
		 2) Line 105: Comment out LEX=lex
		 3) Line 106: Uncomment YACC=bison -y
		 4) Line 108: Uncomment LEX=flex

		Makefile
		 1) Line 67: Change to CHOWN = YOUR WINDOWS USER NAME
		 2) Line 68: Change to CHGRP = None

	Finally, `make all` and `make install` in the root dir.

	If everything goes well, execute `/usr/games/nethack` to run the game.
